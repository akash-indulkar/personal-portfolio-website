    description: "Zapier-like automation platform I’ve built using React + Spring Boot microservices. It empowers users to connect apps, define triggers, and automate tasks — without writing a single line of code.",
    longDescription: `• React.js + TypeScript: Developed the frontend using React.js with TypeScript to ensure type safety, maintainability, and scalability as the application grows. This reduced runtime errors and improved long-term code reliability.

• Spring Boot Microservices:
The backend is structured as independent microservices to ensure modularity and fault tolerance:    

Primary Backend – Manages authentication, user accounts, and flow creation/updates.

Flowrun Listener – Receives external webhook triggers and writes them into the outbox table.

Flowrun Producer – Reads flowrun events from the outbox table and publishes them to Kafka.

Flowrun Executor – Consumes Kafka events and executes the required actions.  
This separation of concerns allows independent scaling of services and easier maintenance.

• AI/LLM Integration (GroqAPI + openai/gpt-oss-120b):
Integrated GroqAPI and openai/gpt-oss-120b to understand and format incoming webhook metadata, enabling workflows to intelligently parse and process webhook payloads before execution.

• Kafka (Event Streaming):
Adopted Kafka as the backbone for event-driven communication, enabling reliable, asynchronous, and high-throughput message delivery between services. This architecture allows BlinkFlow to process thousands of events per second with consistent performance.  

• Redis (Caching & Email OTP):
Used Redis to manage email OTP validation, providing sub-millisecond lookups and reducing repetitive database writes. This improved the responsiveness of authentication flows and decreased load on the primary database.

• Transactional Outbox Pattern:
Implemented to solve the dual-write problem (ensuring both database updates and Kafka event publishing succeed). By using an outbox table as an intermediate step, BlinkFlow guarantees that events are never lost or duplicated, significantly improving system reliability.

• Dockerization & Docker Compose:
Every microservice was containerized with Docker, ensuring environment consistency across local development, staging, and production. Docker Compose was used to orchestrate multiple services (Frontend, Spring Boot services, Kafka, Redis, and MySQL) locally, greatly simplifying developer workflows.

• AWS Deployment:
BlinkFlow was deployed to AWS EC2 instance using Docker containers, with Nginx configured as a reverse proxy.`,

    slug: "redis-powered-otp-protection",
    excerpt: "Designing secure authentication systems requires walking a tightrope between seamless user experience and ironclad protection. Lean too far toward convenience, and you invite abuse. Prioritize security at all costs, and you frustrate legitimate users.",
    content: `• The Authentication Security Gap We Had to Close:  
During BlinkFlow's development, our automation platform's password reset functionality exposed critical vulnerabilities. While OTPs (One-Time Passwords) provide excellent security, they create attractive attack vectors without proper safeguards:  
Attack Vector: Unlimited OTP generation allows malicious actors to overwhelm email infrastructure and enables systematic brute-force attacks against OTP codes.  
We needed a sophisticated rate limiting system that could scale across our distributed architecture while maintaining sub-millisecond response times.  
• Our Password Reset Vulnerability Assessment:  
BlinkFlow's reset flow followed a standard three-step process:  

1. User submits email  
2. System generates and sends OTP via email  
3. User inputs OTP for verification  

• The security gaps were glaring:  

Request flooding: Attackers could trigger thousands of OTP emails, creating infrastructure strain and potential service disruption.  
Brute-force exploitation: Without attempt limits, systematic OTP guessing became feasible.

We required per-user throttling that could operate reliably across multiple service instances.  
• Why Database Storage Falls Short for OTPs:  
Initially, we considered storing OTPs directly in our database, but this approach revealed significant drawbacks:  
Performance Bottlenecks: Database queries for OTP validation add unnecessary latency to time-sensitive authentication flows.  
Cleanup Complexity: Expired OTPs require manual cleanup jobs, creating operational overhead.  
Scaling Limitations: Database writes become a bottleneck during high-volume OTP generation.  
Security Concerns: Persistent storage increases the attack surface and data breach risks.  
Redis eliminates these issues by keeping OTPs in memory with automatic expiration, making the entire flow faster and more secure.  
• Why Redis Became Our Rate Limiting Foundation:  
After evaluating several approaches, Redis emerged as the optimal solution due to its unique combination of features:  
Lightning Performance: Handles tens of thousands of operations per second with minimal latency.  
Atomic Guarantees: Prevents race conditions through built-in atomic operations.  
Distributed Architecture: Maintains consistent state across all BlinkFlow service replicas.  
Native Expiration: Built-in TTL functionality simplifies time-window management.  
• Implementing OTP Request Protection in BlinkFlow:  
We implemented a focused rate limiting mechanism:  
OTP Request Throttling:  
Policy: Maximum 3 OTP requests per user within a 10-minute window  
Redis Key Pattern: OTP_COUNT:{userEmail}:{otpCount}  
Mechanism: Counter incrementation with automatic TTL on request  
java// OTP Generation Rate Limiting —  
Integer OTPcount = (Integer) redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("OTP_COUNT:" + reqUser.getEmail());  
		if (OTPcount == null) {  
			redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("OTP_COUNT:" + reqUser.getEmail(), 1, Duration.ofMinutes(10));  
		} else if (OTPcount >= 3) {  
			throw new AuthenticationException("OTP limit exceeded");  
		} else {  
			redisTemplate.opsForValue().increment("OTP_COUNT:" + reqUser.getEmail());  
		}  

• Measurable Security Improvements:  
Attack Prevention: Eliminated brute-force and spam-based OTP abuse  
User Experience: Preserved smooth authentication for legitimate users  
Infrastructure Protection: Prevented email service overload and associated costs  
Distributed Reliability: Maintained consistent behavior across all service instances  
• Implementation Insights and Optimizations:  
Threshold Calibration—  
Finding the right balance required extensive testing. Overly restrictive limits frustrated genuine users, while lenient policies left security gaps. Our final thresholds emerged from analyzing legitimate user patterns and attack attempt frequencies.  
User Communication Strategy—    
Rather than displaying generic error messages, we implemented context-aware feedback on frontend:  
"You've reached the maximum OTP requests. Please try again in 10 minutes."  
Clear messaging reduced user confusion and support ticket volume significantly.  
The Strategic Impact—  
Redis-powered rate limiting transformed BlinkFlow's authentication security without compromising user experience. The solution proved both elegant in its simplicity and robust in its protection.
For any development team implementing authentication flows, Redis offers an ideal combination of performance, reliability, and built-in features that make rate limiting straightforward to implement and maintain.`,

    excerpt: "Artificial Intelligence dominates headlines today, sparking fierce debates about our future. Will AI become humanity's greatest tool or our replacement? The reality is more nuanced than either extreme suggests. Let's contemplate on how AI will reshape our world and why humans still matter.",
    content: `• Why AI Still Can't Think Like Us:  
Current AI systems, despite their impressive capabilities, remain fundamentally limited. Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun consistently highlights these gaps:     
Today's AI lacks genuine understanding, struggles with memory, and cannot truly reason through complex problems.
These systems excel at recognizing patterns but stumble when confronted with:  
Contextual blindness — AI misses subtle cues that humans instinctively understand.  
Resource intensity — Running sophisticated models demands massive computational power and energy.
Fragmented memory — AI cannot sustain meaningful context across extended interactions.  
Flawed learning — Biased or incomplete training data produces unreliable outputs.  
Style over substance — AI often prioritizes appealing responses over accurate information.  
These fundamental limitations explain why artificial intelligence, in its present state, cannot truly substitute for human cognition.  
• A Vision of Smarter, More Efficient AI:  
Picture a future where these constraints dissolve—where AI develops genuine reasoning abilities, maintains continuous context, and operates sustainably. The implications would be revolutionary.
Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla envisions AI triggering widespread deflation by dramatically reducing costs across industries. Personalized AI tutors could adapt to each student's unique learning style, while AI-powered medical systems could deliver expert diagnostics to underserved communities worldwide.
Yet technology alone won't determine this future. Political decisions, international cooperation, and regulatory frameworks will ultimately shape whether these transformative possibilities become reality or remain unfulfilled potential.  
• Thriving Alongside Artificial Intelligence:  
The crucial question isn't whether AI will eliminate human roles, but rather which individuals will flourish in an AI-enhanced world.
Success will depend on cultivating adaptability through:  
Mastering meta-learning — In an information-rich world, the ability to acquire new skills quickly matters more than memorizing facts.  
Connecting disparate fields — Value creators will link seemingly unrelated domains, weaving together insights from technology, humanities, and social sciences.  
Developing enduring capabilities — Core human skills like leadership, clear communication, and analytical thinking will remain invaluable regardless of technological advances.  
As Alvin Toffler observed: "The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn."
Embracing Transformation:  
AI won't simply replace humans—it will fundamentally transform the landscape we navigate daily. Certain professions will disappear while others emerge, and our relationship with information and knowledge will evolve dramatically.
Those who view AI as a collaborative partner rather than a threat will discover unprecedented opportunities. The future rewards humans who enhance their natural abilities through intelligent systems rather than competing against them.
The winning strategy isn't to become more machine-like, but to become more authentically human while leveraging AI's strengths as a powerful ally.

    excerpt: `Social media has transformed into a digital theater where billions perform daily. Some individuals chronicle every detail of their lives, while others maintain years of digital silence. Most of us occupy the uncertain middle ground, perpetually wrestling with a fundamental question: Is this worth sharing?
Our motivations for posting—or choosing silence—are far more complex than they appear on the surface.`,
    content: `• The Psychology Behind Our Digital Silence:  
Sometimes we abstain from posting for genuinely healthy reasons. We choose presence over documentation, fully immersing ourselves in experiences without the urge to capture and broadcast them. We prioritize being in the moment rather than performing it.
But often, silence stems from deeper anxieties. We hesitate because we fear critique, rejection, or the possibility that our content won't measure up to others' curated highlights. Perfectionism becomes our internal critic, demanding flawless images, witty captions, and ideal timing before we dare share anything authentic.  
• Understanding Our Need to Share:  
Conversely, our posting impulses frequently arise from a fundamental human need for connection and recognition. Each notification—every like, comment, or reaction—delivers a small dose of social validation. These digital responses confirm our existence matters, that others notice and value what we offer.  
• Finding Your Digital Sweet Spot:  
Neither constant sharing nor perpetual silence represents the "correct" approach. Social media platforms are merely tools—their impact depends entirely on how we wield them.
The crucial distinction lies in examining our underlying motivations. Are we sharing because we genuinely want to communicate something valuable, or because we're seeking external validation? Are we holding back due to authentic privacy preferences, or because anxiety has hijacked our decision-making?  
• A Framework for Authentic Engagement:  
Ultimately, life deserves to be experienced rather than constantly staged for an audience. If a moment genuinely moves you and sharing feels natural—embrace that impulse. If you prefer to keep experiences private, honor that instinct equally.
Your worth as a human being cannot be quantified through engagement metrics. Real value emerges from the depth of your experiences, the quality of your relationships, and the authenticity of your choices—both online and off. The most fulfilling digital life aligns with your authentic self, not your audience's expectations.

    title: "Bulletproof Event Delivery: How We Solved Data Inconsistency in BlinkFlow Using the Transactional Outbox Pattern",
    slug: "transactional-outbox-pattern",
    excerpt: "Building event-driven systems sounds straightforward until you hit the reliability wall. The nightmare scenario? Your data and events drift out of sync, leaving your system in an inconsistent state that's nearly impossible to recover from.",
    content: `• The Consistency Problem That Keeps Developers Awake:  
Picture this common workflow: save data to your database, then publish an event to your message broker. Simple, right? Wrong. This seemingly innocent two-step dance can fail spectacularly:  
Scenario A: Database write succeeds, message publishing fails  
Scenario B: Message gets published, database transaction rolls back  
Both outcomes create data inconsistency—a silent killer that corrupts your entire system's integrity.  
• Why This Mattered for BlinkFlow:  
We encountered this exact challenge while building BlinkFlow, our automation platform that connects applications like Zapier does. Since BlinkFlow orchestrates workflows across multiple microservices using event streams, losing even a single trigger could break entire user automations.
Our backend architecture consists of four core services:  
Primary Backend — handles authentication and workflow management  
Flowrun Listener — captures incoming webhook triggers and logs them  
Flowrun Producer — processes logged triggers and routes them to Kafka  
Flowrun Executor — consumes Kafka messages and executes user actions  
The critical bottleneck lived in our Flowrun Listener: every incoming trigger needed to be both persisted in our database and forwarded to Kafka. Treating these as separate operations opened the door to catastrophic data loss.  
• The Transactional Outbox Pattern—Our Solution:  
This pattern elegantly solves the dual-write problem through a staging approach:  
Step 1: Instead of publishing directly to your message broker, write events to a dedicated outbox table within the same database transaction as your main data  
Step 2: A background process reads from this outbox table and publishes events to the message broker  
Step 3: Successfully published events are marked as processed in the outbox  
This approach guarantees that your database state and message broker remain perfectly synchronized.  
• Implementation in BlinkFlow:  
Phase 1: Secure Event Capture (Flowrun Listener)—  
When webhooks arrive, our listener performs atomic dual writes:  

Records the trigger in the flowrun table  
Simultaneously creates an entry in the flowrun_outbox staging table  
Both operations execute within a single database transaction  

Result: Either both writes succeed completely, or neither happens at all—no partial states possible.  
Phase 2: Reliable Event Publishing (Flowrun Producer)—  
Our producer service continuously:  

Scans the flowrun_outbox table for unprocessed events  
Publishes these events to Kafka  
Marks records as processed only after confirmed delivery  

Phase 3: Action Execution (Flowrun Executor)—  
The executor consumes Kafka messages and triggers user-defined actions like API calls, email sends, or data storage operations.
• The Transformative Benefits:  
Absolute Reliability: Events never vanish, even during Kafka outages or network failures  
Clean Separation: Our listener remains completely decoupled from Kafka infrastructure  
Independent Scaling: We can tune producer throughput without affecting other services  
Fault Tolerance: Temporary Kafka unavailability just queues events in the outbox until recovery  
• Hard-Won Insights:  
Polling Optimization: Balancing database load against processing latency required careful tuning  
Duplicate Handling: Building idempotent executors became essential since message duplication can still occur  
Storage Management: Implementing automated outbox cleanup prevented unbounded table growth  
• The Bottom Line:  
For BlinkFlow, the Transactional Outbox Pattern evolved from an architectural nicety to an operational requirement. It delivered the ironclad guarantee that user triggers would flow reliably through our entire execution pipeline without data corruption.
If your architecture bridges databases and message brokers, don't gamble with partial failures. The Transactional Outbox Pattern offers a battle-tested, straightforward solution that's proven its worth in production systems worldwide.
The pattern is simple to implement, but its impact on system reliability is profound.`,

    slug: "the-hypocrisy-mirror-we-avoid",
    excerpt: "We witness it daily, and if we're brutally honest, we participate in it regularly: condemning others for behaviors we quietly excuse in ourselves. Whether it's corporate ethics or mundane daily choices, this psychological phenomenon permeates human interaction more deeply than we care to acknowledge. This is moral hypocrisy—perhaps the most pervasive yet unexamined contradiction in human behavior.",
    content: `• Defining Our Double Standards:  
Moral hypocrisy represents our remarkable ability to harshly judge others for actions we rationalize when we commit them ourselves. This isn't always a conscious choice—often, we remain genuinely oblivious to our own contradictions. Consider these familiar scenarios:  
The Corruption Critic: We denounce political corruption while discreetly offering expediting fees to bypass bureaucratic delays  
The Traffic Judge: We condemn reckless driving while justifying our own red-light violations during urgent moments  
The Honesty Enforcer: We despise deception while crafting "harmless" lies and calling them social lubricants  
In each instance, the moral framework we apply to others mysteriously dissolves when applied to our own circumstances.  
• The Psychology Behind Our Selective Vision:  
Several cognitive mechanisms drive this contradictory behavior:  
Self-Serving Bias—  
Our minds naturally function as personal defense attorneys, crafting elaborate justifications for our mistakes while prosecuting others' identical actions. When we err, it becomes a situational exception; when others err, it reveals character defects.  
Cognitive Dissonance Resolution—  
Mental contradiction creates psychological discomfort that our minds automatically resolve. When we act against our stated values, we unconsciously adjust our moral reasoning to maintain internal peace. However, we apply no such generous reframing to others' behaviors.  
Reputation Management—  
Publicly criticizing others serves as moral signaling—a way to advertise our ethical standards without actually meeting them. This allows us to maintain social credibility while privately operating by more flexible rules.  
• The Hidden Price of Hypocrisy:  
While moral hypocrisy might seem like a minor character quirk, its consequences ripple through society:  
Ethical Erosion: Widespread double standards normalize the very behaviors we publicly condemn  
Trust Degradation: Relationships and institutions suffer when people discover the gap between stated and lived values  
Growth Stagnation: Self-improvement becomes impossible when we consistently blind ourselves to our own shortcomings  
When entire communities operate on these contradictory standards, collective progress becomes virtually impossible.  
• Breaking the Hypocrisy Cycle:  
Escaping this behavioral trap requires deliberate psychological work:  
Practice Self-Examination—  
Before critiquing others, honestly assess whether you've engaged in similar behavior. This simple pause can reveal uncomfortable truths about your own consistency.  
Implement Universal Standards—  
Apply identical moral expectations to yourself and others. If an action is wrong when someone else does it, it remains wrong when you do it—regardless of your circumstances or intentions.  
Embrace Accountability—  
Replace justification with acknowledgment. When you fall short of your standards, admit the lapse rather than crafting explanations that excuse it.  
Cultivate Understanding—  
Extend the same compassionate interpretation to others' mistakes that you automatically give yourself. Recognize that their circumstances might be as complex as yours.  
• The Path Forward:  
Moral hypocrisy isn't a moral failing—it's a universal human tendency rooted in how our minds protect our self-image. Recognition represents the crucial first step toward authentic integrity.
The next time you feel compelled to judge someone's behavior, pause and examine your own track record. You might discover that the qualities you find most irritating in others mirror aspects of yourself that need attention.  
True integrity doesn't demand perfection—it requires consistency in how we evaluate ourselves and others. The standard we set should be universal, not selectively applied based on whose behavior we're examining.`,

    excerpt: `Discover the hidden psychological forces—relative deprivation and cynicism—that drive people to police others' celebrations and dismiss genuine achievements as "not big enough."`,
    content: `• Introduction:  
Maharashtra's recent announcement of 7,000 new Revenue Assistant positions sparked widespread celebration across social media. Families shared their joy, communities offered congratulations, and newly hired candidates expressed their gratitude for this life-changing opportunity.  
But amid the genuine happiness, a dismissive tweet emerged:  
"Why are they celebrating like they've become IAS officers?"  
This single comment reveals profound psychological patterns that govern how we respond to others' achievements—and why some people feel compelled to diminish joy that isn't their own.  
• The Comparison Trap: Understanding Relative Deprivation—  
Relative deprivation describes our tendency to measure success not by its actual impact, but by how it stacks up against the highest possible achievement. Instead of recognizing the genuine value of securing stable government employment, critics automatically compare it to more prestigious positions.  
This psychological phenomenon creates several destructive outcomes:  
Achievement devaluation: Real progress gets dismissed because it doesn't reach arbitrary standards set by comparison  
Chronic dissatisfaction: Constantly measuring against higher benchmarks prevents appreciation of genuine accomplishments  
Context blindness: The life-changing nature of the achievement gets lost in the comparison game  
For many candidates, becoming a government clerk represents financial security, social mobility, and new opportunities—transformative outcomes that deserve celebration regardless of hierarchical positioning.  
• The Cynical Response: When Skepticism Becomes Toxic-
Cynicism manifests as automatic distrust of others' positive emotions and experiences. The dismissive comment about "celebrating like IAS officers" assumes that people's joy is somehow inappropriate or exaggerated rather than authentic.  
This cynical mindset damages both individuals and communities by:  
Eroding social empathy: Dismissing others' happiness creates emotional distance and reduces compassionate connection  
Poisoning collective celebrations: Cynical voices can dampen communal joy and shared success  
Creating negativity cycles: Skeptical attitudes spread through social networks, making celebration feel inappropriate or naive  
• The Philosophical Trap: Why "Only Big Wins" Thinking Is Flawed —  
Some argue philosophically that we should reserve celebration for truly significant achievements—that constant recognition diminishes the value of exceptional accomplishments. This perspective suggests that celebrating smaller victories creates a participation trophy mentality that undermines excellence.  
However, this thinking contains several philosophical flaws:  
The Arbitrary Standard Problem: Who determines which achievements qualify as "big enough"? The line between worthy and unworthy celebration becomes subjectively imposed by others rather than determined by personal impact.  
The Zero-Sum Fallacy: Celebrating one person's achievement doesn't diminish anyone else's success. Joy is not a finite resource that gets depleted when shared.  
The Context Denial: This viewpoint ignores individual circumstances, struggles, and starting points. What appears "small" to an observer might represent overcoming enormous personal obstacles.  
The Motivation Paradox: Research shows that acknowledging progress—even incremental progress—actually enhances motivation for future achievements rather than reducing it.  
From a deeper philosophical standpoint, the "only big wins" mentality reflects an elitist worldview that hierarchically ranks human experiences and deems some unworthy of recognition.  
• When Celebration Crosses the Line: 
While defending the right to celebrate, we must acknowledge that excessive celebration can sometimes become problematic. When achievement recognition transforms into complacency, it loses its motivational power.  
Warning signs of counterproductive celebration:  

Treating single achievements as final destinations rather than stepping stones  
Losing motivation for continued growth and learning after success  
Developing resistance to new challenges due to comfort with current status  

The key lies in balance—celebrating achievements while maintaining forward momentum and growth mindset.  
• Reframing Success Through Psychological Wellness:
Positive psychology research consistently shows that appreciation and gratitude enhance both individual resilience and social cohesion. When we celebrate others' achievements—regardless of their scale relative to our own aspirations—we strengthen community bonds and create positive emotional environments.  
A psychologically healthy response replaces "Why celebrate so much?" with "This achievement matters deeply to them, and that makes it worth celebrating."  
This shift requires recognizing that success operates on multiple scales simultaneously, and each person's victories deserve respect within their unique context.  
• Moving Forward: Balancing Recognition and Ambition -
The Maharashtra recruitment celebration illuminates how we collectively interpret and respond to achievement. When relative deprivation and cynicism dominate our reactions, we diminish genuine accomplishments and create toxic social environments.
Simultaneously, celebration requires intentionality. It should energize future growth rather than create complacency. The most psychologically healthy approach treats every achievement as both worthy of recognition and a foundation for continued development.  
The deeper insight — While progress may be relative to circumstances and context, the joy it brings is absolutely valid. Learning to honor milestones while maintaining the drive for growth creates the optimal mindset for both personal development and social cohesion.
Our response to others' success reveals more about our own psychological state than about the appropriateness of their celebration.`,
